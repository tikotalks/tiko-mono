        Millions of people struggle to communicate. Some can't speak. Some find words hard to access. Others simply do
n’t have the right tools. Most of the apps out there are expensive, complex, or full of clutter. They're built for systems, not for people.

**Tiko is here to fix that.**

It started with one child who needed help to express himself. What followed was the idea that communication tools should be free, simple, and made for real people. Not just children, but anyone who wants to connect.

Tiko is not one big app. It's a growing set of small, focused tools. Each one does a single thing well. No logins. No ads. No confusion. Just tap, speak, and be heard.

We believe that communication is a basic human right. That’s why everything we build is open source, free for everyone, and shaped by the people who use it.

_Tiko is a movement. And it’s just getting started._

Tiko is not one app. It’s a collection of tiny, purpose-built tools. Each app is focused on a single task, whether it's answering yes or no, choosing food, building a sentence, or pointing to an emotion.

This philosophy is what makes Tiko unique. Instead of one complex interface trying to do everything, we create focused apps that are clear and easy to use. Each app is designed for one goal, so there's no clutter, no menus to learn, and no distractions. Just tap and go.

This also means we can move fast. When someone says, "We need an app that lets someone choose their favorite toy, we can build it. When a teacher says, "I need a tool to help students describe actions," we can add it. Tiko grows with its users.

Apps are designed to work across devices. Whether on a tablet, phone, or desktop, everything works instantly and without setup. No accounts required. No internet needed once installed.

_Communication should be simple. So we build simple tools — and as many as needed.`;
