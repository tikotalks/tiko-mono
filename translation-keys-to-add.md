# Translation Keys to Add for Deployment Enhancement

These translation keys need to be added to the database for the deployment and backup features:

## Deployment Keys
- `admin.navigation.deployments.title` = "Deployments"
- `admin.navigation.deployments.targets` = "Deployment Targets"
- `admin.navigation.deployments.backups` = "Database Backups"
- `deployment.version` = "Version"
- `deployment.buildNumber` = "Build"
- `deployment.commit` = "Commit"

## Backup Keys
- `deployment.backups.title` = "Database Backups"
- `deployment.backups.subtitle` = "Manage and monitor database backups"
- `deployment.backups.create` = "Create Backup"
- `deployment.backups.createFirst` = "Create First Backup"
- `deployment.backups.loading` = "Loading backups..."
- `deployment.backups.empty.title` = "No backups found"
- `deployment.backups.empty.description` = "Create your first backup to get started with database management."
- `deployment.backups.createdAt` = "Created"
- `deployment.backups.size` = "Size"
- `deployment.backups.tables` = "Tables"
- `deployment.backups.rows` = "Rows"
- `deployment.backups.tablesIncluded` = "Tables Included"
- `deployment.backups.metadata` = "Metadata"
- `deployment.backups.download` = "Download"
- `deployment.backups.details` = "Details"
- `deployment.backups.delete` = "Delete"
- `deployment.backups.status.creating` = "Creating"
- `deployment.backups.status.success` = "Success"
- `deployment.backups.status.failed` = "Failed"
- `deployment.backups.confirm.title` = "Create New Backup"
- `deployment.backups.confirm.description` = "This will create a new backup of the current database state. Please provide a name and optional description."
- `deployment.backups.form.name` = "Backup Name"
- `deployment.backups.form.namePlaceholder` = "Enter backup name"
- `deployment.backups.form.description` = "Description"
- `deployment.backups.form.descriptionPlaceholder` = "Optional description"
- `deployment.backups.success.created` = "Backup created successfully"
- `deployment.backups.success.deleted` = "Backup deleted successfully"
- `deployment.backups.error.create` = "Failed to create backup"
- `deployment.backups.error.delete` = "Failed to delete backup"
- `deployment.backups.error.load` = "Failed to load backups"
- `deployment.backups.error.download` = "Failed to download backup"

## Existing Translation Key Still Needed
