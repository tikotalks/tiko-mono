## Test Infrastructure

### Testing Setup Files
- **`vitest.config.ts`** - Vitest configuration with Vue support
- **`src/test-setup.ts`** - Global test setup and mocks
- **`src/utils/test-helpers.ts`** - Utility functions for testing

### Mock Setup
- **Speech Synthesis API** - Mocked for testing speech functionality
- **Navigator.vibrate** - Mocked for testing haptic feedback
- **Pinia Store** - Mocked for component testing
- **UI Components** - Mocked @tiko/ui components
- **BEM CSS** - Mocked bemm utility

## Test Results Summary

- **Total Tests**: 80
- **Passing Tests**: 72 (90%)
- **Failing Tests**: 8 (10%)

### Failing Tests Issues
The 8 failing tests are primarily due to:
1. **Mock Store Issues**: Component tests not properly accessing mocked store data
2. **API Mocking**: Edge cases for missing browser APIs
3. **Component Integration**: Some integration issues between mocked components and stores

### Key Features Tested
- ✅ Question management (create, select, history)
- ✅ Speech synthesis functionality
- ✅ Haptic feedback
- ✅ Settings management
- ✅ State persistence
- ✅ Component rendering and interaction
- ✅ Form validation and submission
- ✅ Accessibility features
- ✅ Error handling
