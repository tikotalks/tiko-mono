# Drag and Drop Fix Documentation

## Issue
The drag and drop functionality for reordering sections was not working properly. When attempting to drag sections, the `handleSectionsReorder` function would receive corrupted data structures, causing errors like "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'section_template_id')".

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Data Structure Corruption**: The `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` deep clone method was failing for complex objects
2. **Duplicate Drag Handles**: The component had both a visual drag handle icon and the TDragList's built-in handle
3. **Missing Structure Validation**: No recovery mechanism when drag operation corrupted the data

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Data Structure Handling in `PageDetailView.vue`

```typescript
// Old approach - could fail with complex objects
const clonedSection = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(section))

// New approach - safer object spreading
const updatedSection = {
  ...section,
  pageSection: {
    ...section.pageSection,
    order_index: index
  },
  section: section.section ? { ...section.section } : null,
  content: section.content ? { ...section.content } : null
}
```

### 2. Added Recovery Mechanism

The code now attempts to recover corrupted sections during reorder:
```typescript
if (!section || !section.pageSection) {
  const originalSection = originalSections.find(s => s.id === section?.id)
  if (originalSection) {
    console.warn('Recovered section from original:', originalSection)
    section = originalSection
  }
}
```

### 3. Removed Duplicate Drag Handle

- Removed the visual-only drag handle icon
- Let TDragList component handle all drag functionality
- Updated styles to work with TDragList's structure

### 4. Created Test Component

Added `/test-dragdrop` route with a simple test component to verify drag functionality works correctly.

## How to Test

1. Navigate to `/content/pages/:id` in the admin tool
2. Try dragging sections to reorder them
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify the order is saved correctly

## Alternative Test

Visit `/test-dragdrop` to see a simplified drag and drop implementation that confirms the TDragList component is working correctly.

## Technical Details

The TDragList component uses HTML5 native drag and drop API with:
- Visual feedback during drag (opacity change)
- Drop zone highlighting
- Automatic reordering
- Parent callback for persistence

## Future Improvements

1. Consider using a more robust drag library like Sortable.js
2. Add animation transitions for smoother UX
3. Implement undo/redo functionality
4. Add keyboard support for accessibility
