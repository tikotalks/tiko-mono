# Authentication Flow Test Results

## Summary

- **Total Tests**: 12
- **Passing**: 8 (67%)
- **Failing**: 4 (33%)

## ✅ Working Features

### OTP Authentication

- ✅ Complete OTP flow from email to verification
- ✅ Invalid OTP code error handling
- ✅ OTP verification with proper JWT tokens

### Session Management

- ✅ Session persistence across page reloads
- ✅ User settings preservation during authentication

### Error Handling

- ✅ Rate limit error display (shows "For security purposes...")
- ✅ Network error handling

### Registration

- ✅ Registration form with optional name field
- ✅ Email verification after registration

### Magic Link

- ✅ Malformed token rejection (stays on login screen)

## ❌ Issues to Fix

### 1. Magic Link Hash Not Clearing

**Issue**: After magic link authentication, the hash remains in URL
**Expected**: `location.hash` should be empty after processing
**Actual**: Hash stays as `#access_token=...&refresh_token=...`

### 2. Session Logout Not Redirecting

**Issue**: After clearing localStorage, app doesn't redirect to login
**Expected**: Should show login form after session clear
**Actual**: Stays on authenticated view

### 3. UI Text Mismatches

**Issue**: Button/form texts don't match expected values

- "Use a different email" button might have different text
- "Create Account" header might be different

### 4. Registration Toggle

**Issue**: Toggle between login/register not working as expected
**Expected**: Click "Register" to see registration form
**Actual**: Registration form not displaying

## Recommendations

1. **Magic Link Processing**: Check if `window.history.replaceState()` is being called after auth
2. **Session Reactivity**: Ensure auth store properly reacts to localStorage changes
3. **UI Text Verification**: Update tests to match actual UI text or add data-cy attributes
4. **Component State**: Verify login form properly toggles between login/register states

## Test Coverage

- ✅ Email/OTP authentication
- ✅ Magic link authentication (partial - auth works but hash not cleared)
- ✅ Session persistence
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ User settings integration
- ⚠️ Registration flow (partial)
- ❌ Logout flow

Overall, the core authentication functionality is working well. The issues are mostly related to UI/UX polish and state management edge cases.
